QB:

<ul>
  <li>When drafting a guy, THP and at least decent AWR/THA are a must</li>
  <li>
    SPD and CAR can be factors if the QB isn't exactly a highly accurate guy
  </li>
  <li>
    AWR (From experience, this has a slight effect on accuracy. Also, since I
    play with the QB Vision Cone ON, high Awareness is useful)
  </li>
</ul>

HB:

<p>
  Really depends on what scheme I'm rolling and what backs I have on my roster,
  but I generally split them by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Elusive Back: AGI, ACC, AWR, SPD, CTH, CAR</li>
  <li>Power Back: BTK, CAR, AWR</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If they have 70+ STR and 50+ PBK, that gives them a bonus, since they can
  pickup blitzes. 70+ CTH is also good.
</p>

FB:

<ul>
  <li>When I do get one, they must have solid RBK and STR OR solid CTH.</li>
  <li>
    Either they are solid lead blockers, or they are solid receiving backs. Or
    both.
  </li>
</ul>

WR:
<p>
  I usually have one or two guys that are solid all around, and multiple
  situational/role players here.
</p>
<p>
  My #1 and #2 need solid athletic ability (88+ in SPD, AGI and ACC, preferably
  more) and great CTH (92+) and AWR (92+).
</p>
<p>
  JMP is up for grabs with these guys, although it helps. Same with CAR and BTK.
</p>
<p>Since I tend to have 6 WRs in my roster, I have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    At least 2 slot receivers (High AGI kind of guys with high ACC too for good
    measure, usually one of my top 2 receivers can play in the slot, and tends
    to do)
  </li>
  <li>
    At least a tall, Red Zone receiver (90+ JMP, 6'2'' or more. AGI is not too
    important as they usually line up on the outside)
  </li>
  <li>
    1 or 2 chains moving possession receiver (Can be both of my top 2 receivers
    or my slot receiver)
  </li>
  <li>
    The 6th guy is a backup that could develop into a decent or good starter, or
    an amazing returner. Sheer Athleticism or sheer skill and awareness are the
    driving factors when it comes to drafting.
  </li>
</ul>

TE:

<p>I look for Possession TEs so SPD isn't a big deal. JMP is, as it is CTH.</p>
<p>
  My #1 and #2 TEs must be solid receivers on their own, with some ability to
  block.
</p>
<p>The #3 either needs solid CTH as well, or preferably great RBK and STR.</p>

OT:

<ul>
  <li>The top factors for LT are PBK, STR, RBK, AWR</li>
  <li>For RT the order is RBK, STR, PBK, AWR</li>
  <li>
    SPD doesn't apply to them unless you want them to pull somehow (There are
    playbooks that have plays with pulling tackles)
  </li>
  <li>
    ACC and AGI help a bit, the first with getting push at the line, the other
    at dealing with speed rushers
  </li>
  <li>For draftees, I focus on STR and at least decent PBK/RBK</li>
</ul>

G:

<ul>
  <li>I focus on STR, RBK, PBK, AWR, SPD, ACC</li>
  <li>SPD does play a part here as they do pull</li>
  <li>
    ACC once again helps getting push at the line, AGI helps with twists, as
    does AWR
  </li>
  <li>On draftees I focus on STR once again</li>
</ul>

C:

<ul>
  <li>For them I focus on STR, AWR, PBK, RBK</li>
  <li>Unless you have a playbook where the C pulls, SPD is irrelevant</li>
  <li>ACC helps at the line, AGI ... in their case it doesn't help much</li>
  <li>AWR helps with blocking extra rushers</li>
  <li>For draftees, I focus on STR and at least decent PBK/RBK</li>
</ul>

DE:

<p>If I run a 3-4, I want STR (Think 90+), AWR and TAK for my DEs.</p>
<p>In a 4-3, it depends:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    For my LE, I want STR (80+ does the trick here), AWR and TAK, with decent
    AGI and ACC
  </li>
  <li>
    For my RE, I want AGI, ACC, SPD (For these 3, high 70s to low 80s does the
    trick), AWR, TAK
  </li>
  <li>LEs are run stoppers, REs are speed rushers</li>
</ul>

DT:

<p>For 3-4: You want a massive guy with STR (94+) and TAK, along with AWR.</p>
<p>
  For 4-3: You can slack a bit in STR (Still try for 90+, although the high 80s
  do the trick) for some AGI and ACC (High 50s to low 60s is good enough for
  DTs).
</p>

MLB:

<p>I run with at least 4 MLBs in my roster (When I use the 3-4 that is):</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The first two need to distinguish themselves with solid AWR, solid TAK (80+
    in both) and decent athleticism
  </li>
  <li>The 3rd must be like the first 2, just with less AWR</li>
  <li>
    The 4th must be a highly athletic guy, as he is the pass coverage LB. TAK
    and AWR isn't as important with this guy, he just needs to keep up with HBs
    and TEs.
  </li>
</ul>

OLB:

<p>In a 3-4, both OLBs need to fit the mold a 4-3 RE would fit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High SPD, AGI, ACC (in the 80s range), TAK and AWR</li>
  <li>STR can be useful for run stopping</li>
</ul>
<p>In a 4-3, both OLBs would be similar to the MLB:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solid AWR (80+), decent TAK, solid athleticism</li>
</ul>

CB:

<p>This depends on what kind of coverage you run the most:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zone: Prioritize AGI, ACC, SPD and AWR</li>
  <li>Man: Prioritize AWR, SPD, ACC, AGI</li>
  <li>CTH is always useful, as is TAK</li>
</ul>

S:

<ul>
  <li>
    I usually prefer a more athletic, rangier guy at FS (So SPD, AGI, ACC, AWR,
    TAK)
  </li>
  <li>And box safety at SS (TAK, ACC, AWR, AGI, SPD)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Usually, I want my safeties to serve in Big Nickel and Big Dime sets (3
  Safeties sets), so I have 1 or 2 guys that can play FS reliably.
</p>

K and P:

<p>Your first priority should be KPW, followed by AWR and THEN KAC</p>
<p>
  Low Awareness has a serious effect on kicking ability, specially on CPU
  controlled kickers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    On User controlled kickers, the accuracy meter is tougher to hit (It is
    smaller and it moves faster, specially on pressure kicks)
  </li>
  <li>On CPU controlled kickers, they'll outright miss more</li>
</ul>
