<h1>Quarterbacks:</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Speed, Awareness, Throw Power, Throw
  Accuracy.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed:</strong> Anything from 99 to 80 talk about the QB being a
    great threat on the run and on open field. Anything 79 to 60 talk about how
    he has the adequate speed and can buy some time in the pocket. Lower than 60
    and it says, not very mobile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> 99 to 97 praise the QB as being extremely smart,
    kind of like Peyton Manning. 96 to 90 talk about the QB being great at
    reading defenses. 89 to 87 talk about how he's generally able to find an
    open man. Lower talk about his decision making, especially under pressure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Throw Power:</strong> 99 to 92 praise his arm strength. 91 to 83
    call it above average to average. Lower and his arm strength is criticized.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Throw Accuracy:</strong> 99 to 92 praise his arm accuracy. 91 to 83
    call it above average to good. Lower and it says that he needs to work on
    his mechanics.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Speed is what is expected. Same with Throw Power
  and Throw Accuracy. Awareness is the decision making and the capability to
  look for another receiver and not force a pass. It also alters the QB Vision
  Cone.
</p>

<h1>Halfback</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Agility, Speed, Acceleration, Awareness,
  Carrying, Break Tackles (Trucking)
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Agility:</strong> Anything 99 to 92 like his lateral movement speed.
    Lower up to 83 call it decent enough. Lower and it says that the back lacks
    elusiveness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed:</strong> Anything higher than 90 is liked. 86 to 85 is called
    Average NFL Speed, with anything lower said that the back is not fast.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Acceleration:</strong> Just like in a lot of these. From 99 to 92,
    it says they like his explosiveness through the hole. Lower is still good,
    up to 87. Then they don't like it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> Apparently this controls Ball Carrier Vision:
    They like it from 99 to 90. On the 89 to 87 line it says "Needs to slow down
    and learn how to develop his blocks.". I have never seen a running back show
    patience in this game. Like, I've seen them cutback inside, but I've never
    seen them allowing the Linemen to come infront of him and block. Maybe is
    because my sliders make the run blocking suck (17 Run Block).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Carrying:</strong> It says nothing. Except on the 78 to 0 range, in
    which it says that fumbles can be a problem.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Break Tackles:</strong> They like it from 99 to 90, saying that he
    "Keeps pads low to the ground and delivers a blow upon contact.". That's
    about it.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Agility is juking ability, spins and
  elusiveness. Speed is what you expect. Acceleration is explosiveness through
  the hole. Carrying is exactly that. Break Tackles is Trucking. Awareness
  should be patience and Ball Carrier Vision.
</p>

<h1>Fullback</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Awareness, Catching, Pass Blocking, Run
  Blocking.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> Anything above 82 is well likes. They like his
    instincts and is rarely caught out of position. Lower and they call his
    awareness average.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Catching:</strong> Surprising that Halfbacks don't have this one
    too. Anyway, anything over 80 is great. Over 70 is good. And over 62 is
    decent.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pass Blocking:</strong> They like his blitz pickup skills when over
    62. And they still like it when over 51.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Run Blocking:</strong> They like his lead blocking when over 80, and
    is still great when over 70. Lower and they hate it.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Awareness is how he recognizes what's going on
  around, probably who to block. Catching is that. Pass Blocking is how likely
  he's to pick up a player when his assignment is Pass Block. Same with Run
  Blocking.
</p>

<h1>Wide Receiver</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Agility, Speed, Acceleration, Awareness,
  Catching, Jumping.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Agility:</strong> They like anything above 92, saying that he can
    make defenders miss in the open field. Anything below 82 is disliked.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed:</strong> They like anything over 90, saying he's fast enough
    to get behind most DBs ... I've seen this before (Deep Threat). Less than
    82, he's called a possession receiver.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Acceleration:</strong> Again, they like his explosiveness of the
    snap when over 90. They hate it when less than 82.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> Again, over 90 they like it, saying that he has
    great instincts and runs great routes. At the 81 to 74 range it says "Not a
    great route runner. Struggles to find his place vs. zone coverage.".
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Catching:</strong> They like anything over 90. The 89 to 87 range is
    called erratic. 82 to 79 is called average.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Jumping:</strong> They like anything over 92. Less than 78 and they
    start disliking it. Less than 73 it says: "Not a big threat on jump balls on
    fade routes."
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Agility is Elusiveness and cut speed. Speed is
  that. Acceleration is that. Awareness is route running. Catching is that. And
  Jumping is exactly that.
</p>

<h1>Tight End</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Speed, Awareness, Catching, Run Blocking,
  Jumping.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed:</strong> They like anything over 84. Over 80 is decent.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> Over 80, they like his recognition skills
    against zone.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Catching:</strong> Over 80, they like it. Less and it's decent.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Run Blocking:</strong> They just like it over 70.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Speed is just that. Awareness is their play
  recognition and route running. Run Blocking is their capability to engage a
  block. Catching is that.
</p>

<h1>Offensive Line</h1>

<p>
  I read the descriptions for everyone, and they seem the same for every
  offensive lineman. As I understand it, the Guards are better run blockers, the
  Center is the smartest lineman as well as a good pass blocker, the Left Tackle
  is the best Pass Blocker and the Right Tackles is a great run blocker. I'll
  take the descriptions from the Left Tackle.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Strength, Awareness, Pass Blocking, Run
  Blocking.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Strength:</strong> They prefer anything over 92, but still like over
    90. The 86 to 83 range says "Has problems with bull rushers over the top.".
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> Same as Strength, they prefer over 92, but still
    like over 90. The 99 to 92 range says "Rarely loses a matchup once he's
    locked onto the defender."
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pass Blocking:</strong> They like anything over 92. They still like
    over 90, but no as much. They don't like him below that.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Run Blocking:</strong> They like him over 92. In the 91 to 90 range,
    he's called an asset in the running game. Below 82, they don't like him.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Strength is the capability to cope with the Bull
  Rush Power Move. Awareness is the capability to cope with Finesse Moves (Spins
  and Rips). Pass Blocking, as well as Run Blocking server as multipliers for
  this.Next up we have: The Defense, followed by The Special Teams.
</p>

<h1>Defensive End</h1>

<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Strength, Speed, Acceleration, Awareness.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Strength:</strong> They like anything over 90, saying that "Could
    interchange at DE or DT with his strength.". I'd say you want a 3-4 DE with
    95 Strength, otherwise get him out of there or use the 4-3. 89 to 85 seems
    to be the minimum the game likes. Lower than 80 and it says "More of a
    finesse rusher."
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed:</strong> They like everything over 80, saying that he has
    "Scary speed for a defensive end.". The 74 to 69 range is average.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Acceleration:</strong> They love this one over 90. They don't like
    it below 77. The 99 to 90 range says: "Closing burst is so disruptive that
    it causes fumbles and hurried throws."
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> They like it over 92, saying that he is "Intense
    playmaker that has a real nose for the big play.". The 82 to 76 range says
    "Overruns too many plays and makes mental mistakes.".
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Strength seems to control the Bull Rush power
  move and might globally control block shedding. Speed is just that.
  Acceleration is self explanatory. Awareness SEEMS to control the finesse
  moves, or the likehood of the DE to use moves, be it power or finesse, to shed
  a block.
</p>

<h1>Defensive Tackle</h1>

<p><strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Strength, Awareness, Tackling.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Strength:</strong> They like anything over 95, saying that "Has the
    upper body strength to maintain separation from opposing lineman.". Over 90
    is still good. They start to dislike it below 85.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> They like it over 90. Not so much below 80. The
    89 to 85 range says "Shows the consistency and effort of an upper echelon
    player.".
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tackling:</strong> They like it over 95, but over 89 is still good.
    The 88 to 83 range says "Decent tackler.".
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Just like above, Strength appears to control the
  Bull Rush Power Move and might globally control Block Shedding. Awareness
  seems to control the likehood of the use of moves to shed blocks. Tackling is
  exactly that.
</p>

<h1>Linebacker</h1>

<p>
  Now, the game descriptions assume that OLBs and MLBs act as the same. Of
  course, when you run a 4-3, this is somewhat accurate. All linebackers are
  Off-the-ball Linebackers. When you run a 3-4, not so much. The MLBs are
  off-the-ball Linebackers, whereas the OLBs are Edge Rushers. I'll use the
  descriptions of the MLB because they are the same as that of the OLBs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Speed, Acceleration, Awareness, Tackling.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed:</strong> They like him over 85, saying "One of the fastest
    linebackers; really a sideline to sideline defender.". The 79 to 75 seems to
    be average. Below 67 it says "Very slow for a linebacker. May end up moving
    to rush end."
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Acceleration:</strong> They like him over 92, as most of these
    descriptions do. The 79 to 72 seems to be the average. That range says
    "Below average explosion when closing. Can be exploited on the blitz."
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> Above 92 it says "Tremendous instincts; shows
    natural playmaking ability.". The 85 to 80 range seems to be average.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tackling:</strong> Naturally, over 92 they like him. The 91 to 88
    range says "Breaks down in the open field, wrapping up the ballcarrier." Not
    sure if that is good or bad.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Speed is just that. Acceleration is
  explosiveness of the snap. Awareness is play recognition. Tackling is ... well
  ... tackling. This MIGHT or MIGHT NOT influence the capability of forcing
  fumbles. Not sure, they don't make any comments about it.
</p>

<h1>Cornerback</h1>

<p><strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Agility, Speed, Awareness, Jumping.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Agility:</strong> They like him over 96 all the way up to 90. They
    start hating at 85.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed:</strong> They like him over 97 all the way to 90. Then they
    don't like him. The 94 to 90 range says "Has good speed for an NFL corner."
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> Above 94 it says "Is always one of the most
    intelligent corners in the NFL.". Below 84 they don't like him. I'm
    realizing these might be the triggers for some of the players weapons. SOME.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Jumping:</strong> They like him above 95 all the way to 90. They
    hate him below 85.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Agility is quickness when turning. Speed is just
  that. Awareness is play recognition and coverage ability. Jumping is ... well
  ... that.
</p>

<h1>Safety</h1>

<p>Both Safeties are considered equal according to the descriptions.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Speed, Acceleration, Awareness, Tackling.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed:</strong> They like him over 92, saying "About as fast as it
    gets at safety." They still like him at 87. 86 to 82 seems average.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Acceleration:</strong> They like him over 92, again. The 91 to 87
    range is called average.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Awareness:</strong> Above 90 is good, saying "One of the most
    intelligent safeties in the NFL.". Below 83, they don't like him. Below 76,
    it says "His instincts, namely his angles of pursuit, leave a lot to be
    desired."
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tackling:</strong> Above 84 it says "Devastating tackler that
    punishes receivers over the middle.". They still like him above 78, saying
    "Loves to tackle and dole out punishment.". The average seems to be 77 to
    72. Key part here. The 71 to 65 range says "Should not be involved in run
    support."
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Speed is that. Acceleration is explosiveness off
  the snap. Awareness is play recognition and pursuit. Tackling is ... that.
</p>

<h1>Kicker</h1>

<p><strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Kick Power, Kick Accuracy, Awareness.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Kick Power: They like him over 95, all the way to 85. The 89 to 85 range
    says "Decent leg strength. Can make it from the high forties to low 50's.".
    The next range, 84 to 80 says "Doesn't have a great leg. Struggles on
    kickoffs and long attempts.".
  </li>
  <li>
    Kick Accuracy: They like him over 94, almost calling him Adam Vinatieri.
    Well, not so much. But it says "About as close to automatic as it gets in
    terms of accuracy.". They still like him up to 89. Below, not so much.
  </li>
  <li>
    Awareness: This rating. All right. Over 92 it says "Able to make the kicks
    that he's expected to and come up big in the pressure moments.". The 91 to
    82 range says "Solid kicker that can be counted on when needed.". The 81 to
    77 range says "Is inconsistent at times but is usually dependable.". Below
    that it says "Poor confidence leads to too many misses.".
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Kick Power and Kick Accuracy are exactly what
  you expect. However, Awareness is interesting. Awareness seems to be either
  Clutch Factor and/or Confidence. And apparently below 77 is bad. Very bad.
</p>

<h1>Punter</h1>

<p><strong>Involved Ratings:</strong> Kick Power, Kick Accuracy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Kick Power: They like him over 95, all the way to 85. The 89 to 85 range
    says "Pretty strong leg strength. Not great, but sufficient.". The next
    range, 84 to 80 says "Average leg strength. ".
  </li>
  <li>
    Kick Accuracy: They like him over 92, saying "He has upper echelon accuracy
    on placements.". They still like him up to 82. Below, not so much.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Kick Power and Kick Accuracy are exactly what
  you expect. Is interesting that Awareness does not seem to be a factor here,
  which is interesting.
</p>
